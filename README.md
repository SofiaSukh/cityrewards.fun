## Design Philosophy

### "Show, Don't Tell"
The design demonstrates impact and opportunities rather than simply describing them. The dashboard and map are central to this approach.

### "Eth as Background Infrastructure"
While blockchain is fundamental, the focus is on citizen benefit and utility, not technical complexity. Technology ensures trust and transparency invisibly.

### "Positive-Sum Growth & Regeneration"
The design visually communicates how the platform contributes to a vibrant local economy and sustainable future.
